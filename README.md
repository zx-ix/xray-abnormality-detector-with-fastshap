# xray-abnormality-detector-with-fastshap
This is my final year project spanning 2 semesters (Semester 2 2024 and Semester 1 2025).

A two-stage abnormality detector in musculoskeletal radiographs using DeiT-B as backbone for both stages, fine-tuned on MURA dataset via transfer learning. Paired with fastSHAP visualisation for individual explanability behind every normal/abnormal decision.
